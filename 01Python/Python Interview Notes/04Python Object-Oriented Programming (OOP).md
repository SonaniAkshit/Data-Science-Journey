# üß† Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

---

## üí° What is OOP?

**OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** is a paradigm that structures code around **objects** and **classes**, rather than functions alone.
Objects combine **data (attributes)** and **behavior (methods)** together ‚Äî making code reusable, modular, and scalable.

---

## üîπ Why OOP for Data Science?

In data science, you often build **pipelines**, **custom models**, and **data structures**.
OOP helps you:

* Structure complex ML or ETL code cleanly
* Build reusable components (data loaders, preprocessors, model wrappers)
* Reduce redundancy and improve collaboration

For example: you can create a `DataCleaner` class or `ModelTrainer` class with methods like `train()`, `evaluate()`, `save()` etc.

---

## üî∏ Core OOP Concepts in Python

---

### 1. **Class and Object**

**What:**
A class is a **blueprint**; an object is an **instance** of that class.

**How (Code):**

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, color):
        self.brand = brand
        self.color = color

    def show(self):
        print(f"{self.color} {self.brand}")

# Object
car1 = Car("Tesla", "Red")
car1.show()
```

**Why (Data Science):**
You can model datasets or models as objects (e.g., `Dataset`, `NeuralNetwork`), each having properties and functions.

---

### 2. **`__init__` Constructor**

**What:**
Special method called automatically when creating an object ‚Äî used for initialization.

**How:**

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, marks):
        self.name = name
        self.marks = marks
```

**Why:**
Automatically prepares object with required parameters (like data files, models, etc.) at creation.

---

### 3. **Instance Variables & Methods**

**What:**
Variables & methods tied to a specific object (accessed with `self`).

**How:**

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
```

**Why:**
Every dataset/model instance can maintain its own state or parameters.

---

### 4. **Class Variables & Methods**

**What:**
Variables shared by all instances.
Use `@classmethod` for class-level operations.

**How:**

```python
class Employee:
    company = "Google"  # class variable
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
```

**Why:**
For global constants (e.g., learning rate, model version, etc.) shared across all objects.

---

### 5. **Static Methods**

**What:**
Methods that do not depend on instance or class variables.

**How:**

```python
class MathOps:
    @staticmethod
    def square(x):
        return x*x
```

**Why:**
Useful for data utility functions like scaling, normalization, etc.

---

### 6. **Encapsulation**

**What:**
Hiding internal data from direct modification; achieved using `_` or `__` prefix.

**How:**

```python
class Account:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__balance = 1000
```

**Why:**
Protect sensitive data like configurations, API keys, or credentials in ML pipelines.

---

### 7. **Inheritance**

**What:**
Allows a class to use methods and attributes of another class.

**How:**

```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Bark")
```

**Why:**
Create specialized classes (e.g., `LinearRegression`, `LogisticRegression`) that inherit from a base `Model` class.

---

### 8. **Polymorphism**

**What:**
Same method name, different implementations depending on class.

**How:**

```python
for animal in [Dog(), Cat()]:
    animal.speak()
```

**Why:**
You can handle different ML models or datasets uniformly.

---

### 9. **Abstraction**

**What:**
Hiding implementation details; only showing essential info.

**How:**

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass
```

**Why:**
Create base classes for models or data pipelines with mandatory method definitions.

---

### 10. **Magic (Dunder) Methods**

**What:**
Built-in double-underscore methods like `__str__`, `__len__`, `__add__`, etc.

**How:**

```python
class Vector:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.x = x
    def __add__(self, other):
        return self.x + other.x
```

**Why:**
Allows custom behavior for data objects (e.g., vector addition, matrix operations).

---

### 11. **Composition**

**What:**
Using objects of one class inside another.

**How:**

```python
class Engine:
    def start(self): print("Engine started")

class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.engine = Engine()
```

**Why:**
Modularizes code (e.g., `Pipeline` having `Preprocessor`, `Model`, `Evaluator`).

---

### 12. **Object Introspection**

**What:**
Inspecting object properties/methods dynamically (`type()`, `dir()`, `id()`, etc.)

**How:**

```python
print(type(car1))
print(dir(car1))
```

**Why:**
Useful for debugging large codebases or checking model attributes dynamically.

**Q47. How does polymorphism enable model switching?**
**A:** You can switch models easily as long as they share same interface.

---

**Q48. What OOP features are used in sklearn library?**
**A:** Classes, inheritance, encapsulation ‚Äî every model (like `LinearRegression`) inherits from a common estimator base class.

---

**Q49. Why prefer OOP over functional programming in ML?**
**A:** OOP is better for large, modular, maintainable systems; functions alone are fine for small scripts.

---

**Q50. How would you design a `DataPreprocessor` class?**
**A:**

```python
class DataPreprocessor:
    def __init__(self, df):
        self.df = df
    def clean(self):
        ...
    def normalize(self):
        ...
```

This modularizes and reuses preprocessing steps efficiently.
