#### Probability & Combinatorics

1. A dice is thrown once. Find the probability of getting a 2 or 5.
2. A card is drawn from a deck of 52 cards. Find the probability of getting a red card or a king.
3. A number is chosen from 1 to 10. Find the probability that it is even or divisible by 3.
4. A bag has 3 red and 2 blue balls. A ball is drawn randomly. Find the probability of getting red or blue.
5. A spinner has 6 equal parts numbered 1 to 6. Find the probability of spinning 1 or 6.
6. A card is drawn twice with replacement. Find the probability that both cards are spades.
7. A card is drawn without replacement, then another card is drawn. Find the probability that both are aces.
8. A coin is tossed twice. Find the probability of getting head on both tosses.
9. A dice is rolled twice. Find the probability that first die = 3 and second die is even.
10. A bag contains 4 white and 2 black balls. Two balls are drawn without replacement. Find probability both black.
11. A coin is tossed once. Find the probability of getting a tail.
12. A dice is thrown once. Find the probability of getting a number greater than 4.
13. A card is drawn from a deck. Find the probability that it is a queen or a red card.
14. A box contains 2 red, 3 blue, and 5 green balls. One ball is drawn. Find probability it is green.
15. A dice is rolled twice. Find the probability that both numbers are odd.
16. A coin is tossed 3 times. Find the probability of getting exactly 2 heads.
17. A bag has 4 yellow and 1 black ball. Two balls are drawn without replacement. Probability both yellow?
18. Two cards are drawn together from a deck. Find the probability that both are kings.
19. A spinner with 4 equal sections numbered 1 to 4 is spun twice. Find probability both spins show same number.

#### Hypothesis Testing (Inferential Statistics)

1. A coin is tossed 50 times and shows 30 heads. State null and alternate hypotheses to check fairness.
2. A factory claims its bulbs last 1000 hours on average. Formulate hypotheses to test this claim.
3. A new teaching method is applied. Formulate hypotheses to test whether it improves marks.
4. A company claims 40% of customers prefer online shopping. Formulate hypotheses to test this.
5. If p-value = 0.03 and Œ±=0.05, should you reject the null hypothesis?
6. If p-value = 0.15 and Œ±=0.05, what is your decision about the null hypothesis?
7. Explain what it means if p-value < Œ± in hypothesis testing.
8. If Œ±=0.01, what is the confidence level of the test?
9. Heights of 10 male and 10 female students: Which test will you perform to check difference in means?
10. A training program is introduced. Employee performance is measured before and after. Which T-test to use?
11. A dice is rolled 120 times. Use Chi-Square test to check if the dice is fair.
12. A chips brand claims average packet weight = 50g. You weigh 10 packets: `[49, 52, 51, 50, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 50]`. Use One-Sample T-Test.
13. A hospital claims a new medicine has a 70% success rate. In a trial of 20 patients, 12 recovered. Use a proportion test.
14. A survey of 30 people records gender (Male/Female) and favorite drink (Tea/Coffee). Perform Chi-Square test to check dependence.
15. A factory claims its bulbs last 1000 hours on average. You test 8 bulbs: `[980, 1005, 995, 1010, 1000, 985, 1020, 990]`. Use One-Sample T-Test.
