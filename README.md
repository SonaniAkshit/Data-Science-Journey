# Data Science Journey  
**Beginner to Expert Roadmap**  

Welcome to the **Data Science Journey**. This roadmap takes you from beginner to expert step by step. Each phase builds on the previous one, combining theory, coding practice, and projects to help you become a confident Data Scientist.

### 3: File Handling, Error Handling, Modules, Comprehensions  
- File operations: read, write, count words/lines, CSV handling.  
- Exception handling: `try-except`, multiple errors.  
- Custom modules and imports.  
- List comprehensions and generators.  

### 4: OOPs + Logic Building (50–100 problems)  
- String processing: unique characters, pangram check, Caesar cipher, palindrome substrings.  
- Text handling: remove punctuation/HTML tags, validate email/URL, extract hashtags/emails/numbers.  
- File operations: find and replace, clean text files.  
- OOPs concepts and practice with classes and objects.
